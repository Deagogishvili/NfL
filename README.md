### Abstract

Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is an early non-specific biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic brain injury, indicating axonal damage. We selected a primary calibrator to develop a reference measurement procedure (RMP) and as a part of this workflow, we undertook structural characterisation of human recombinant NfL. We assessed its solvent accessibility and H-bonding profile under three different conditions in KPBS, artificial cerebrospinal fluid and artificial cerebrospinal fluid in the presence of human serum albumin. Our results revealed that NfL is a structurally heterogeneous protein eliciting a large conformational flexibility. Its behaviour differed when it was dissolved in an aqueous buffer versus a surrogate matrix, artificial CSF and/or artificial CSF with human serum albumin. We identified various regions of protection and deprotection in its head and tail domain and in particular in its helical domains that experienced altered solvent accessibility and conformational changes caused by the different solvent conditions examined here. Moreover, we showed evidence of an interaction between NfL and human serum albumin emerging from the HDX-MS data and pinpointed the regions of the protein backbone amides that may participate in this. Overall, we provide critical quality attributes for a potential primary calibrator for NfL measurements. These findings will ultimately inform ongoing biochemical and clinical assay development procedures and manufacturing practices giving careful considerations during sample handling and method development.

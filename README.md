### Abstract

Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is an early non-specific biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic brain injury, indicating axonal damage. This work selects a primary calibrator to develop a reference measurement procedure (RMP) for NfL and, as a part of the described workflow, structural characterisation of human recombinant NfL was undertaken. Its sequence, higher order structure as well as solvent accessibility and H-bonding profile were assessed under three different conditions in KPBS, artificial cerebrospinal fluid and artificial cerebrospinal fluid in the presence of human serum albumin. The results revealed that NfL is a structurally heterogeneous protein eliciting a large conformational flexibility. Its behaviour differed when it was diluted with an aqueous buffer versus a surrogate matrix, artificial CSF and/or artificial CSF with human serum albumin. Various regions of protection and deprotection in the protein head, central helical and tail domains that experienced altered solvent accessibility and conformational changes caused by different solvent conditions were identified. Moreover, evidence is provided for a potential direct interaction between NfL and human serum albumin emerging from the HDX-MS. This pinpointed the regions of the protein backbone amides that participated in such interaction. Overall, critical quality attributes for a potential primary calibrator for NfL measurements are provided. These findings will ultimately inform ongoing biochemical and clinical assay development procedures and manufacturing practices giving careful considerations during sample handling and method development.

B, Predicted structure of NfL-HSA complex by AlphaFold 3 colour-coded with the prediction confidence and C, Statistically significant regions from HDX-MS data overlaid on the predicted complex of NfL with HSA which were determined in MEMHDX (p-value 0.001) following comparison of NfL in aCSF vs. aCSF in the presence of HSA across all time points. Blue denotes protection, red deprotection, pale cyan represents regions which were not statistically significant, grey indicates residues that were not present in the sequence coverage, and HSA is shown in wheat colour. Blue regions near the wheat coloured HSA are suggestive of a potential binding interface.
